## Viewing Timetable ##
When you go to the the application URL, by default, you will see the Timetable View page.   There are three main items on the page;
  * Calender Control
  * Type Control
  * Time Table View

The Time Table View is the main display on the default page.  It shows the timetable for a certain resource for particular week of the year and according to specific timeslots for each day. The timetable window will show the scheduled resources as links in the various timeslots. These resources are abbreviated as the _subject code + class group ID + resource_ index. A resource index indicates the type of resource such as lecture, lab or tutorial.

A timeslot for a day can have zero, one or more resources. Clicking on the link in a timeslot which has at least one resource will cause a Detailed Time Slot Window to be displayed. This provides the details for the resources in the specific timeslot.

The calender allows you to select the date or week for the TimeTable that you want to view.

  * By Class
