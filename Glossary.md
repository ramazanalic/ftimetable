## Cluster ##
In cases where a campus has sites separated by fairly long distances it is necessary to cluster sites together so that a program can have classes shared across sites within a particular cluster. Normally the sites are separated by less than 1Km and allows lecturers and students to travel effortlessly between the sites in the cluster. A large site that has no adjacent sites can be established as a cluster on its own.
